                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                    Our website idea is about tourism in Egypt and exploring its tourist attractions. We are a team of
                    five people, each with a specific role based on their expertise. We have many features, such as the
                    "Company" section, which is a part of the website dedicated to a company that books tickets for
                    tours to Egyptian tourist sites. Tickets can be booked online, which reduces pressure on ticket
                    counters at tourist attractions. Tourists simply show their ticket on their phone at the entrance
                    and enter immediately. Another feature is VR (Virtual Reality), which is a paid feature. This makes
                    it easier for tourists who find it difficult to travel or don't want to go out because of the heat.
                    They can wear VR glasses and experience being at the location virtually, but through 3D glasses. We
                    also have a feature for volunteers assisting people with disabilities. This is for people with
                    special needs who want to visit tourist attractions in Egypt but are unable to do so independently.
                    We provide them with a volunteer to assist them on their trip. However, before assigning a
                    volunteer, we review their CV to ensure they are suitable to care for someone. Another feature is
                    the "Workshop Place," where we dress tourists in traditional Egyptian clothing, similar to Nubian
                    attire, and let them try their hand at Egyptian crafts, such as pottery making. In the future, we
                    will create a page for "hidden gems" in Egypt, showcasing beautiful places that are not well-known.
                    We will also create an interactive game for children, similar to a puzzle. When the child completes
                    the puzzle, a tourist attraction in Egypt will appear with information about it in a cartoon format.
                    We will also add a voice assistant for visually impaired people and create a completely offline
                    program for tourism in Egypt. We are "Team ExoToura," and thank you.
